A momentum strategy is an investment strategy that seeks to take advantage of the trend-following behavior exhibited by financial markets. The strategy is based on the belief that assets that have performed well in the recent past will continue to perform well in the near future, and assets that have performed poorly will continue to perform poorly.

In a momentum strategy, investors typically buy assets that have shown positive price performance over a specific period, such as the past three to twelve months. They expect that the positive price trend will continue, allowing them to capture further gains. Conversely, assets with negative price performance are typically sold or avoided, as they are expected to continue declining.

Momentum strategies can be applied to various types of assets, including stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities. They are often implemented using quantitative models and techniques, with investors analyzing historical price data and calculating various momentum indicators to identify assets with strong positive or negative momentum.
